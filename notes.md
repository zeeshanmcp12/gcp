## Region & Zones

### Region

- Region is a geographical location (like US, Asia, Europe, Japan, etc) where gcp is hosting multiple zones.
- Zone is discrete data center connected with low latency.
- Region can have 3 or more zones. For example, us-west-1, us-west-2

### Select Region that nearest to customer

- GCP has a nice tool called *[Region Picker](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/region-picker/)*.
  - We can pick the right region based on the incoming traffic from our application.
  - We can use this tool by selecting three different parameters.
    - Carbon footprint
    - Price
    - Latency
